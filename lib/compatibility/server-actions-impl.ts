"use server"

/**
 * This file contains server action implementations
 * These are separated from client components to comply with Next.js requirements
 */

// Add any server actions that were previously in server-actions-wrapper.tsx here
// For example:
export async function exampleServerAction(data: any) {
  // Implementation
  return { success: true, data }
}

// Add more server actions as needed
